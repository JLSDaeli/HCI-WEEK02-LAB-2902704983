     <h3>Name</h3>
    <p> Jakarta has had several names throughout its history. The earliest was linked to the Buni people (400 BC–500 AD), 
        a pottery culture that thrived along the northern coast of West Java. In the 4th century, the city was called Sundapura, 
        mentioned in the Tugu inscription of the Tarumanagara Kingdom, which controlled the Sunda Strait and trade routes to India and China.

    <p>
        After Tarumanagara’s decline, it became Sunda Kelapa (669–1527), serving as the main port of the Sunda Kingdom. 
        In 1527, Muslim forces under Fatahillah expelled the Portuguese and renamed it Jayakarta, from Sanskrit meaning “victorious act.” 
        Europeans later referred to it as Jacatra or Jacarta.

        When the Dutch East India Company seized control in 1619, the city was renamed Batavia, honoring the Batavi tribe. 
        Known as the “Queen of the Orient,” Batavia was admired for its canals, mansions, and planned city design, later expanding into greener suburbs.

    <p>
        During the Japanese occupation in World War II, it became Jakaruta Tokubetsu-shi (Jakarta Special City). 
        After independence, the name was officially changed to Djakarta, and since 1972 it has been spelled as Jakarta, the name it still carries today.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        <dt><i>Precolonial Era</i></dt>
        <dd>The Jakarta area was first home to the prehistoric Buni culture (400 BC–100 AD) and later became part of the Tarumanagara Kingdom in the 4th century, 
            as shown by the Tugu inscription describing irrigation works. After Tarumanagara declined, the region belonged to the Sunda Kingdom, with Sunda Kelapa 
            serving as a key port. By the 13th century, it came under Srivijaya influence, known for pepper trade. In 1522, the Sunda Kingdom allied with the Portuguese, 
            but in 1527 Fatahillah of Demak defeated them and renamed the port Jayakarta, which later became part of the Banten Sultanate. Both Dutch and English traders 
            arrived in the late 1500s.</dd>

        <dt><i>Colonial Era</i></dt>
        <dd>In 1619, after conflicts with Prince Jayawikarta, the Dutch seized control and renamed the city Batavia, making it the capital of the Dutch East Indies. 
            The city grew with the arrival of Chinese, Arab, and native migrants, though tensions led to events like the 1740 massacre of 5,000 Chinese. 
            By the 19th century, Batavia expanded southward into areas like Menteng and Kebayoran Baru. The Japanese captured the city in 1942, renaming it Jakarta. 
            After WWII, the Dutch name Batavia lingered internationally until Indonesia’s full independence in 1949, when Jakarta officially became the capital.</dd>

    <p>
        <dt><i>Independence Era</i></dt>
        <dd>Indonesian nationalists declared independence in 1945, but Jakarta only regained capital status in 1950 after the revolution. 
            Under President Sukarno, major projects such as Monas and Hotel Indonesia transformed the city into a symbol of national pride. 
            In 1966, Jakarta became a special capital region with provincial status. Governor Ali Sadikin (1966–1977) modernized infrastructure 
            but also displaced slum communities and restricted migration. The 1997 Asian financial crisis hit Jakarta hard, sparking protests and riots in 1998 
            that killed over 1,000 people and forced President Suharto to resign. Since then, Jakarta has been a focal point for Indonesia’s democratic reforms 
            but has also faced terrorist attacks in the 2000s and 2010s. In 2007, Jakarta held its first direct gubernatorial election.</dd>

    <p>
        <dt><i>Recent Developments</i></dt>
        <dd>Under President Joko Widodo, plans were made to move the capital to Nusantara in East Kalimantan, though the move has been delayed. Despite challenges, 
            Jakarta remains Indonesia’s political, cultural, and economic heart.</dd>
