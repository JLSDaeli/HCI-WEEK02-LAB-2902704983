        <dt><i>Recent Developments</i></dt>
        <dd>Under President Joko Widodo, plans were made to move the capital to Nusantara in East Kalimantan, though the move has been delayed. Despite challenges, 
            Jakarta remains Indonesia’s political, cultural, and economic heart.</dd>
    </p>

    <h3>Developments and Conditions</h3>
    <p>
        <dt><i>Economy</i></dt>
            <dd>Jakarta is Indonesia’s economic powerhouse, generating a large share of the nation’s GDP. It is home to the Indonesia Stock Exchange, Bank Indonesia, 
                and the headquarters of many national and multinational companies. The city thrives on trade, services, finance, manufacturing, and creative industries. 
                Its port, Tanjung Priok, is the busiest in Indonesia, while Soekarno–Hatta International Airport serves as the country’s main air gateway. 
                Despite its wealth, economic inequality is significant, with poverty and unemployment remaining challenges.</dd>
   </p>
    <p>
        <dt><i>Demographics</i></dt>
        <dd>Jakarta’s population is highly diverse, with over 10 million residents in the city proper and more than 30 million in the metropolitan area. 
            The majority are Javanese and Sundanese, alongside large Betawi, Chinese, Batak, Minangkabau, and Malay communities. Islam is the dominant religion, 
            followed by Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism. The city is known as a cultural melting pot, reflecting migration from across 
            the Indonesian archipelago.</dd>
    </p>
    <p>
        <dt><i>Culture</i></dt>
        <dd>Jakarta blends traditional and modern culture. The Betawi people, considered the native ethnic group, have distinct traditions in music, dance, clothing, 
            and cuisine, influenced by Arab, Chinese, Indian, and European cultures. The city is also a hub for Indonesian art, film, theater, and festivals, 
            and it hosts major museums such as the National Museum of Indonesia. Popular entertainment includes shopping malls, nightlife, and sports, while annual 
            events like Jakarta Fair and Jakarta International Film Festival highlight its cosmopolitan character.</dd>  
    </p>
    <p>
        <dt><i>Transport</i></dt>
        <dd>Jakarta’s rapid urban growth has created severe traffic congestion. To improve mobility, the city has developed bus rapid transit (TransJakarta), 
            commuter rail, a new MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) system, and LRT (Light Rail Transit). Ride-hailing apps are widely used, but motorcycles and cars still dominate. 
            Soekarno–Hatta International Airport is the main aviation hub, while Halim Perdanakusuma Airport serves domestic flights. Seaports such as Tanjung Priok handle 
            shipping, and toll roads connect Jakarta with other cities in Java.</dd>

    </p>
    <p>
        <dt><i>Climate</i></dt>
        <dd>Jakarta has a tropical monsoon climate, with a long rainy season from October to May and a shorter dry season between June and September. 
            Rainfall is heaviest in January and February, while August tends to be the driest month. Temperatures remain fairly steady year-round, averaging 
            around 32 °C during the day and 24–25 °C at night. High humidity and frequent flooding are common due to the city’s low-lying geography.</dd>
