    Jakarta, formerly called Batavia until 1949, is the capital and largest city of Indonesia. 
    It lies on the northwest coast of Java and functions as both a province-level region 
    and the biggest metropolis in Southeast Asia. Despite being the smallest province by area, 
    its metropolitan region—including Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi—has over 32 million residents, 
    making it the second-largest urban area in the world after Tokyo.

    The city has long been an important center, from its origins as Sunda Kelapa in the 4th century, to its role as Batavia under Dutch rule, 
    and later its establishment as Indonesia’s capital with special provincial status in 1960. Today, Jakarta is the country’s economic, political, 
    and cultural hub, hosting ASEAN’s headquarters, major financial institutions, and a diverse mix of cultures and religions.

    Jakarta also faces major challenges such as overpopulation, pollution, traffic congestion, and land subsidence, 
    with parts of the north sinking rapidly. To address these issues, the government approved moving the capital to Nusantara in East Kalimantan, 
    while still investing heavily to improve Jakarta.
